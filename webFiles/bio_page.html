    <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
    <img id="mee" src="https://mybiostaticweb.s3.amazonaws.com/me.jpg" alt="Me">
    <p>Hello! My name is Elias. I am 25 years old and I am currently looking into the field of technology. I am current
        in an
        apprenticeship with multiverse and also employed at Deloitte as a cloud engineer apprentice! I am very excited
        to see what the future holds and where I will be in the next couple of years.

    <h2 align="center">My two dogs!</h2>
    <p>
        I have two dogs! I have a mix labrador and golden retriever. His name is Canelo! He is really
        energetic. He is always running
        around in circles in the backyard. The pther one is a mixed labrador and corgi. This littles guy's name is
        Marley! He is a labrador and a corgi mix. This guy HATES
        running. He prefers to sit and sleep most of the time instead. They're a good pair I would say.
        Canelo is always trying to play with Marley and they both get in some exercise together. <br />
        <br />

    <h3 align="center">Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I've always been intriuged in multiple subjects. I've always had an intrest in fitness, baking and traveling.
        Lately I've picked up reading and have been enjoying it so far. I am about half way through my first book and
        will more than likely start looking at another book soon. But below are three of my most favorite hobbies at
        the moement.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Powerlifting: This is a strength sport in which involves the Bench Press, Squat, and Deadlift. I ended up
            competing
            in the summer of 2020 and won 1st place in my weight class.</li>
        <li>Baking: This consist of flour, water and yeast. I help around a few of my friends bakery shop and also bake
            pastries
            whenever I have free time.</li>
        <li>Hiking: Whenever I have downtime in the evening, I'll go hiking to place called Piestewa. This place has
            such a nice view
            at the top.</li>
