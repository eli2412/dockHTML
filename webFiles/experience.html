    <h1>Experience and Education</h1>

    <header>
        <h2>GCU</h2>
        <p>I was in university for a few years trying to finish up my exercise science degree but in the last
            couple of years I switched to computer science. Although I didn't finish, I learned quite a lot from
            the classes I took.
        </p>

    <main>
        <aside>
            <h3>Classes</h3>
            <p>During my time in university, I learned Java, C# and front end development as well. All of this
                sparked my interest in software developement. I learned the basic fundamentals and also created small
                projects.
                I also learned some data structures and algorithms which was intresting to know the time processes in
                computing.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <h2>Infosys</h2>
        <p>Before working at Infosys, I joined a bootcamp called New apprenticeship. Here I was taught ServiceNow and
            to make tickets, read tickets and use their workflow app. This helped me land my position at Infosys and work as a tech
            support associate.
        <aside>
            <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>
                My time at Infosys was an experience. I was taught SQL and a bit more of python to go along with it.
                I was also taught in how to create Grafana Dashboard and put data in a more appealing and visual way.
                Although,
                I couldn't get much experience. It was one step towards my career goals.

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>I am now on the road in becoming a cloud engineer at Deloitte and am excited for how the future will play
            out.
            With the help of Deloitte and Mulitverse, I am closer to making my path towards to my goals.
